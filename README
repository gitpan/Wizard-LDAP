NAME
    Wizard::LDAP - Administration interface for your LDAP server

SYNOPSIS
      # From the shell:
      ldapWizard

      # Or, from the WWW:
      <a href="ldap.ep">LDAP administraton</a>

DESCRIPTION
    This is a package for administration of an LDAP server. It allows to
    feed users, hosts and networks into the server.

INSTALLATION
    First of all, you have to install the prerequisites. There are lots of:

    An LDAP Server
        You need some LDAP server. We are using the OpenLDAP server, see

          http://www.openldap.org/

        In theory any other LDAP server should do, but the servers
        configuration might be different.

        A source RPM for Red Hat Linux is available on demand.

        To configure the LDAP server, edit the file topics.ldif from the
        distribution. Currently it looks like

          dn: topic=user, dc=ispsoft, dc=de
          name: user 
          objectclass: topic

          dn: topic=net, dc=ispsoft, dc=de
          name: net 
          objectclass: topic

        Change "dc=ispsoft, dc=de" to reflect your local settings. For
        example, if you are using the mail domain "mycompany.com", then you
        might choose

          dc=mycompany, dc=com

        Import the file into your LDAP server by using the command

          ldif2ldbm -i topics.ldif

        (The above command will trash an existing LDAP database! Use ldapadd
        if you want to avoid this.)

        Append the files slapd.at.conf.APPEND and slapd.oc.conf.APPEND to
        your /etc/openldap/slapd.at.conf and /etc/openldap/slapd.oc.conf and
        restart the OpenLDAP server.

    IO::AtomicFile
        This is a Perl package for atomic operations on important files.

    HTML::EP
        If you like to use the WWW administration interface, you need the
        embedded Perl system HTML::EP.

    Wizard
        Another Perl module, available at the same place.

    Convert::BER
    Net::LDAP
        To talk to the LDAP server, we use Graham Barr's Net::LDAP package.
        It is written in 100% Perl, no underlying C library required.

    All the above packages are available on any CPAN mirror, for example

      ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/authors/id

    or perhaps at the same place where you found this file. :-)

    Note that some of the packages have their own requirements. For example,
    HTML::EP depends on libwww and the MailTools. If so, you will be told
    while installing the modules. See below for the installation of the Perl
    modules.

  Installing the Perl modules

    Installing a Perl module is always the same:

      gzip -cd Wizard-LDAP-0.1005.tar.gz | tar xf -
      cd Wizard-LDAP-0.1005
      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    Alternatively you might try using the automatic installation that the
    CPAN module offers you:

      perl -MCPAN -e shell
      install IO::AtomicFile
      install Bundle::HTML::EP
      install Bundle::Wizard
      install Convert::BER
      install Net::LDAP
      install Wizard::LDAP

    Note that some of the modules, in particular HTML::EP, need additional
    configuration tasks, for example modifying the web servers configuration
    files.

  Some final tasks

    You have to create a directory /etc/LDAP-Wizard and make it owned by the
    httpd user, so that CGI binaries can write into this directory.

    Copy the file ldap.ep into your web servers root directory. (I choose
    /home/httpd/html/admin/ldap.ep on my Red Hat Linux box.)

    Point your browser too the corresponding location, for example

      http://localhost/admin/ldap.ep

    Start with modifying the preferences.
