This file describes, how you have to setup your LDAP server (openldap)
for the usage of Wizard::Examples::LDAP.

1. Append the content of the file slapd.oc.conf.APPEND to the
   slapd.oc.conf file of your ldap server.

2. Edit the topics.ldif file and replace <YOUR_BASE> to the
   base you want the software to use (Note that this must be the same base
   you are going to enter in the preferences)

3. Use "ldapadd" to apply the changes describe in the topics.ldif file,
   for example:
     /usr/sbin/ldapadd -D "cn=root, dc=ispsoft, c=de" -w secret -f topics.ldif

4. Hope, that everythings run fully compliant to your expectations... ;-)
